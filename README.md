#### Amiga playfield example

This is a conversion of a piece of code from the **Amiga Hardware Reference Manual - Second Printing - July 1986 (page 55)**
under the heading "examples of forming basic playfields"

Essentially it is a translation of Motorola 68000 assembly to C language code, utilising SDL2 obviously instead of banging the metal directly to display the output.

The file playfield.s is the original 68000 assembly.

The code really serves no purpose, just a demonstration.
